# How to use this Project

## Dependecies
> gymnasium (pip install gymnasium) \
> gym (pip install gym) \
> numpy (pip install numpy)

## How to run
> navigate to the project folder "Applied_Machine_Learning_Projekt" \
> if you want to learn at first, run "learning.py" either in Pycharm or in Console (python learning.py) \
> if you want to see the result of the learning or the pretrained model, run "displayresult.py" in Pycharm or in Console (python displayresult.py) \

## How it was trained
> It is a population of Agents And they were trained using Neuroevolution. \
> The results of training will be saved in the *.pickle file. \
> My best results are saved in "checkpoint008.pickle" \
> The rewards of a Generation are stored in the *.txt files \
> Caution: When running learning.py, one must edit the file names in learning.py, otherwise the model file and reward file will be overwritten
